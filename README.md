# evoluspencil
Make charts and UI mockups using this open-source GUI prototyping tool
for GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac.

Please delete your repo and fork the upstream evolus copy if you have
code to contribute:

https://github.com/evolus/pencil

Why? Because there are pages and pages of search results on GitHub for
evoluspencil which are imports from
https://code.google.com/p/evoluspencil/, making finding any versions
with improvements impractical. These copies are also missing years of
commits that are available on the evolus repo. Lets work together
instead.
